Hi! My name is Graham. In this README page were you will find out a little about me, my website, my coding journey, my projects and who has influenced me in my development.

# About me.

After 20 years in my previous career (healthcare) During the pandemic I decided I needed a change, and I found coding, I am currently self-learning how to develope & design web-sites,
this self-learning is done through on-line tutorials and Youtube videos(links below),
In September 2022 i will be taking this development further by starting
a Professional Diploma course in Full Stack Software Developement with University College Dublin/Code Institute.

# Coding Journey.

I am very new to coding and have no tech background. Only in August 2022, my wife came across an ad for a Full Stack developer course with University College Dublin and Code Institute, after a little research and doing the 5 day challenge, I became additted and couldnt get enough and I havent looked back since.
